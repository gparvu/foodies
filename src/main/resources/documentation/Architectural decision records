Spring Boot to benefit from easy setups and bindings

Use Contract-First approach for easier collaboration between teams and also to leverage code gen tools. Contracts are our entry points so should be given the needed attention

Open API 3 -> widely accepted standard and addapted to be more inclusive of Links ( complete Restfull services) , Oauth2 and OpenID Connect Discovery ( microservices)
OpenAPI 3.1 -> still needs some time to have a mature ecosystem around it

For sake of simplicity we will support only on mediatype, the application/Json. Multiple types could be supported for multiple clients based on needs.

JPA3 as persistance layer for maximum portability
ManyToMany relationship for recipes and ingredients as some ingredients may belong to few recipes and to improve that search performance.

Postman can be used targeting localhost:8081 for the endpoints described in foodies_api_specification.yaml
